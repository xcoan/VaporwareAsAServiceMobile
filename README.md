# WaveWare

A Vapoware as a Service App.

## Usage

Software and Startups are off-the-wall in the modern tech industry.  Everyone who's
anyone has a startup these days.  But sometimes, the tech industry can be hard to
get into, especially if you don't have technical skills.

We've set out to solve that problem.


WaveWare is the world's first Vaporware as a Service app.
What is vaporware? Vaporware is a term for theoretical software that has
disappeared over time- thus becoming like vapor.  Vaporware is ever present in the
modern software world with several new Startups opening for business daily to hopefully
create the next big app.

How does WaveWare work?
WaveWare generates a product idea for you.  From there, it integrates with
modern social platforms and crowdfunding websites.  WaveWare then automatically
sends updates to all these platforms periodically- making it seem like you're making progress.
These updates slow down over time, making allowing potential users and supporters to one day
forget the application all together.

Now YOU have the power to say you have a failed tech startup.

#### PhoneGap CLI

The hello-world template is the default when you create a new application using the [phonegap-cli][phonegap-cli-url].

    phonegap create my-app

Create an app using this template specifically:

    phonegap create my-app --template hello-world

## [config.xml][config-xml]

#### android-minSdkVersion (Android only)

Minimum SDK version supported on the target device. Maximum version is blank by default.

This template sets the minimum to `14`.

    <preference name="android-minSdkVersion" value="14" />

#### &lt;access ...&gt; (All)

This template defaults to wide open access.

    <access origin="*" />

It is strongly encouraged that you restrict access to external resources in your application before releasing to production.

For more information on whitelist configuration, see the [Cordova Whitelist Guide][cordova-whitelist-guide] and the [Cordova Whitelist Plugin documentation][cordova-plugin-whitelist]

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)

The default CSP is similarly open:

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src * 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; media-src *" />

Much like the access tag above, you are strongly encouraged to use a more restrictive CSP in production.

A good starting point declaration might be:

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self' data: gap: 'unsafe-inline' https://ssl.gstatic.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; media-src *" />

For more information on the Content Security Policy, see the [section on CSP in the Cordova Whitelist Plugin documentation][cordova-plugin-whitelist-csp].

Another good resource for generating a good CSP declaration is [CSP is Awesome][csp-is-awesome]
